# Principles

Below are some of the common principles of programming:

## KISS

KISS stands for 'Keep it simple stupid'. It refers to the fact that simplicity in your code is often a good solution. You don't need to overcomplicate things if you can avoid it.

## YAGNI

YAGNI stands for 'You aint gonna need it'. Essentially meaning don't build features or future proof everything for things you might never need. 

## DRY

DRY stands for 'Dont repeat yourself'. This is to ensure you don't have duplicate code, keeping it DRY makes your code easier to maintain.

## SOLID

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

* Single-responsibility principle[6]
    * A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
* Openâ€“closed principle[7]
    * "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
* Liskov substitution principle[8]
    * "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
* Interface segregation principle[9]
    * "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[4]
* Dependency inversion principle[10]
    * One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[4]

## SoC

SoC stands for 'Seperation of Concerns' MVC is an architecture pattern that tries to implement a good seperation of concerns.

## Avoid premature optimisation

This highlights how optimisation can be detremental unless you actually need to do it. 

## Law of dementer

The Law of Dementer is a guide for developing software specifically Object Oriented Programming. Essentially the law is about loose coupling and stopping classes or objects becoming closely tied together. The 3 rules describe the law:

* Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
* Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
* Only talk to your immediate friends.
